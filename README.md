## 👋 About Me

I have a PhD in mathematics focused on data analytics and data science. Using Python, SQL, and AI-assisted development, I build clean, explainable data workflows—from raw data to insights, models, and dashboards. I combine mathematical rigour with practical, production-ready solutions.

I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights and interactive dashboards. My academic training taught me to think critically, solve abstract problems step by step, and communicate complex ideas clearly. Teaching and research experience strengthened my ability to explain **why** things work, not just **how**.

On this GitHub, you’ll find projects ranging from **fraud detection and salary prediction** to **dashboards, management systems, and interactive apps**. Each reflects my approach: **understand the data, validate assumptions, and deliver results that make sense to people**.

I’m currently focused on growing as a **data analyst or data scientist**, building tools that turn raw data into actionable insights, and contributing to projects where mathematics, programming, and real-world impact intersect.
