## 👋 About Me

I’m a mathematician and researcher with 5+ years of programming experience, now focusing on **data analytics and data science**. I specialise in using **Python** and **SQL** to turn data into insights, build predictive models, and create interactive dashboards.  

As an **AI-powered programmer**, I use tools like **Cursor** and GitHub Copilot to automate repetitive coding tasks, speed up development, and focus on **logic, usability, and results**. This allows me to deliver **clean, production-ready data workflows** more efficiently.  

My PhD in Mathematics trained me to think critically, solve complex problems, and work with abstract models. Combined with my **portfolio of applied data projects**, I bring both **analytical rigour** and **practical coding experience** to data-driven roles.
